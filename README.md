Android quiz game based on Las Vegas trivia.

I originally wrote this around 2014 before a trip to Vegas with some friends as a joke, to play while bar-crawling.

My first foray into mobile programming on the Android platform.
I used the standard Android SDK available at the time and played around with a few of the available APIs (XML, Layouts, Icons, Toasts, etc).
Testing was done on an emulator and a companion unit-test project.
