# SinQuizCityAndroidNative
Android quiz game based on Las Vegas trivia.

I originally wrote this around 2013/2014 before a trip to Vegas with some friends as a joke, to play while bar-crawling.

My first foray into mobile programming on the Android platform.

I used the standard Android SDK available at the time and played around with a few of the available APIs (SharedPreferences, XML Parser, Layouts, Icons, Toasts, etc). Manual testing was done on an emulator and automated testing via a companion unit-test project.

Originally assembled using Eclipse Juno, Android SDK and libs\android-support-v4.jar (not in source control).

TODOs: Tidy-up, refactoring, more tests and possibly Maven-ize at some point
